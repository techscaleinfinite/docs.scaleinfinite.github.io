**Qovery: Simplifying Cloud Infrastructure Management**

. What is its mission? To make DevOps, Platform, and Engineering teams' life easier by automating the provisioning, setup, and administration of cloud resources.

**Empowering DevOps Teams**

Qovery is a game changer for DevOps teams. It simplifies provisioning and maintaining infrastructure resources, allowing for faster environment setup and takedown. This not only saves time, but it also minimises the amount of effort necessary to manage environments. Qovery doesn't stop there; it also offers resource usage optimisation, which may drastically reduce cloud prices and make infrastructure expenditure more efficient. DevOps can focus on delivering actual value to the company by freeing up resources. Maintaining a high degree of control, security, and governance is a breeze with Qovery. It enables teams to create, administer, and monitor infrastructure as code, reducing human error and ensuring best practises and security standards are followed.

**Qovery: A Boon for Developers**

Developers, too, reap substantial benefits from Qovery. It simplifies the process of spinning up services, requiring minimal effort. This means developers can concentrate on what they do best—writing code and delivering features—without the headache of infrastructure management. Qovery's environment and configuration management capabilities ensure consistency across development, staging, and production environments. This consistency reduces the risk of errors and ensures that applications are always ready for deployment. Security-conscious developers can rest easy knowing that Qovery provides robust control and governance features, ensuring that environments comply with best practices and security standards.

**Qovery: Tailored for Success**

Qovery is, in essence, the deployment platform that every DevOps has wished for. It is not just about deploying apps; it is also about operating production workloads with the highest possible uptime. Qovery enables developers to deploy their apps autonomously while keeping flexibility and control. It's the right option for DevOps workers looking to: Create an internal Platform as a Service (PaaS) with a superior developer experience. Easily create development, staging, and production environments. Make developers self-sufficient while yet maintaining control. Purchase a production-ready infrastructure and save over 18 months of labour.

**Bridging the Gap**

Qovery serves as an abstraction layer on top of potent tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and Helm, along with various cloud service providers like AWS, Digital Ocean, and Scaleway. Its goal is to provide a production-ready platform layer, enabling organizations to build on top of it.

**Your Cloud Infrastructure with Qovery**

The _Qovery installation tutorials make it simple to set up the platform on your AWS and Scaleway accounts_. To function properly, Qovery requires the installation of a few services on your cloud account. Some are required, while others are optional, allowing you the freedom to customise the infrastructure to your specific requirements..

**Security and Isolation**

You may rest certain that your infrastructure is totally separated from the Qovery control plane. Your apps and data are hosted in your cloud account, while Qovery's Engine and Agent services provide smooth connectivity while preserving strict security. Qovery is designed to minimise the effect on your infrastructure in the event of outages or security breaches. Qovery is the bridge that simplifies difficulties, empowers developers, and streamlines operations in the realm of DevOps and cloud infrastructure management, making it a must-have in the toolset of modern engineering teams.
