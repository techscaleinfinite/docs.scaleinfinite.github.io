# ðŸ–¥ Homer Deployment

### What's is homer?

_Homer is a user-friendly, self-hosted dashboard that simplifies the management of your various services and applications. This web-based dashboard offers quick and convenient access to a wide range of self-hosted tools and services from a single interface. It's designed to streamline your experience in organizing and interacting with your self-hosted applications, enhancing accessibility and productivity._

### **How It Works:**

Homer simplifies the process of configuring and accessing your self-hosted services through these key steps:

1. _**Configuration**:_ Begin by defining the services you want to include in your Homer dashboard using a YAML configuration file. In this file, you list the names, URLs, and icons associated with each service you wish to access.
2. **Dashboard Interface**: After setting up your configuration, you can access your Homer dashboard through a web browser. The dashboard offers an organized and user-friendly view of your services, making it straightforward to locate and launch them.
3. **Service Accessibility**: Each entry on the dashboard typically features an icon, a service name, and a URL link. Clicking on either the icon or the name of a service opens a new tab or window in your browser, taking you directly to the designated URL of that service.
4. **Customization**: Homer goes the extra mile in terms of customization. You can personalize the appearance of your dashboard by selecting different themes, layouts, and colors that align with your preferences.
5. **Quick Access**: With Homer, there's no need to remember individual URLs or maintain a complex list of bookmarks for your self-hosted services. The dashboard provides a centralized hub, simplifying access to everything you need.

In essence, Homer transforms the way you interact with your self-hosted applications and services, offering a seamless and efficient solution for managing and accessing them all from a single, user-friendly interface.

**Step-by-Step Guide to homer Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: homer
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: homer
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration****:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `8080`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```bash
           -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an HOMER instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
