### What's Next cloud?

Nextcloud is a remarkable open-source solution for self-hosted cloud storage and collaboration. It grants you the power to safeguard, synchronize, and exchange an array of digital assets, including files, documents, images, and much more. It represents a secure and private alternative to conventional commercial cloud storage services. With Nextcloud, you retain control over your data, ensuring both its protection and accessibility.

### **How It Works:**

**Installation and Setup: Creating Your Cloud Haven** To start your journey with Nextcloud, think of it as your secret vault for files. You need a server or hosting provider, and Nextcloud software will be your magic key to transform it into your personal cloud storage. During this setup, you'll become the admin and customize Nextcloud to fit your style.

**File Handling: Your Digital Filing Cabinet** Once you've set up shop, Nextcloud becomes your digital filing cabinet. Just like other cloud storage services, you can upload files, create folders, and neatly arrange your digital stuff to match your workflow.

**Syncing Made Simple****: Your Files on All Devices** But what's cooler is how Nextcloud keeps everything in sync. It's like having magical elves working in the background. Your files stay updated on all your devices - computer, phone, tablet, you name it. It doesn't matter where you are; your stuff is with you.

**Share with Ease: Collaborate Like a Pro** Nextcloud gives you the power to share files and folders effortlessly. It's like sharing a pizza; you decide who gets a slice. You can make things public or invite specific friends to the feast. Plus, you can set rules ‚Äì whether they can only look, make changes, or take the whole pizza (download). It's collaboration made easy.

So, Nextcloud is your personal file haven. It's not just about storage; it's about keeping everything in line, wherever you go. It's like having your own magical file manager, plus a team of elves to help you share the goodies! üåüüìÇüì§üçï

**Step-by-Step Guide to nextcloud Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: nextcloud
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: nextcloud
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: HTTP
   * Port: 8080
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       * /var/www/html
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an nextcloud instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
