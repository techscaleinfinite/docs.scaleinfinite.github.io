# ðŸ“± Friendica Deployment

### Friendica: Decentralized Social Networking

With a focus on privacy, customization, and interoperability with other federated networks, Friendica empowers users to connect, share, and control their online experience. It's an open-source and user-centric social platform fostering a diverse and decentralized digital community.
