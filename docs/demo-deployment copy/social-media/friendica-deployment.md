### What's friendica?

Friendica is a free and open-source social networking platform that provides a decentralized and federated alternative to commercial social media networks. Here's how Friendica works:



**User Registration:** Just like entering a welcoming community, users can create their accounts on Friendica servers. It's as easy as signing up for any traditional social media platform.

**Decentralization****:** Friendica is the embodiment of democracy in social media. Instead of a central authority, it operates on a federated model, similar to email. It's like a web of communities where each Friendica server is like a town, and users from one town can visit and interact with users from other towns.

**Federation Protocols:** Think of Friendica as a multilingual diplomat. It speaks various federation protocols like ActivityPub, Diaspora, and OStatus. These protocols bridge the gap between different social networks and platforms, allowing Friendica users to connect and interact with users on other federated social networks.

**Profile and Content Creation:** It's your canvas to express yourself. Users can create profiles, share posts, images, links, and videos. It's like an art studio where you can showcase your creations and personalize your space.

**Privacy and Control:** Friendica takes privacy seriously. It's like having a personal bouncer at the door. You decide who gets to see your posts, and you have precise control over your connections and interactions.

**Friendica Add-ons:** Friendica is all about customization. It offers a variety of add-ons and extensions that you can install to tailor your experience. It's like a buffet of features where you can pick and choose what suits your taste.

**Interactions:** It's a bustling social scene. You can follow others, send friend requests, and engage in conversations through comments, likes, and sharing. It's like attending a lively party where you can strike up conversations with interesting people.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Friendica is like a polyglot. Thanks to its federation protocols, you can interact with users on different federated social networks. It's like speaking multiple languages and making friends from around the world.

**Hosting and Community:** Friendica offers the best of both worlds. You can self-host it on your private server or be part of a community. This flexibility means you can choose the level of control and privacy that suits you best.

**Open Source:** Friendica is an open book. Its source code is freely available for anyone to read, modify, and contribute to. It's like a community garden where everyone can pitch in and ensure the platform remains free and open for all.

In essence, Friendica is a social networking platform that champions user privacy, decentralization, and the ability to connect with other federated social networks. It's a refreshing alternative to centralized social media, giving you the reins to control your online interactions and data. It's the digital town square where your voice matters

### **How It Works:**

**decentralized Network:** Think of Friendica as a constellation of communities. It doesn't have a central ruler; instead, it's a tapestry of independently operated nodes, each like a unique village. There's no one-size-fits-all; you get to choose where you want to belong.

**Node Selection:** Joining Friendica is a bit like choosing a neighborhood. You can either create your own community by setting up your Friendica instance or become part of an existing one. Each instance is like a friendly neighborhood where users interact and share.

**User Registration:** Registering on Friendica is as straightforward as signing up for a local club. You provide your username, password, and email address. Some instances might have their own house rules or additional requirements, like a friendly neighborhood committee ensuring everyone gets along.

**Interoperability:** Friendica is like a social diplomat. It speaks the language of other federated social networking platforms, such as Diaspora, Mastodon, and GNU Social. This means you can visit and chat with friends from other digital towns. It's like having a seamless highway that connects different cities.

**Profile Creation:** Once you're in, it's time to set up your digital home. You create your profile, adding personal information, profile pictures, and all the details that make you unique. Just like decorating your real home, you can customize your privacy settings to determine who gets to visit and see your content.

In essence, Friendica offers you the freedom to choose your digital community, be it a bustling metropolis or a cozy town. It's all about connecting with others, sharing stories, and customizing your online experience. It's the social network that puts you in the driver's seat.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Friendica Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `friendica`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `friendica`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration****:**

5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```console
           /var/www/html
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an Friendica instance with your chosen configurations.
