# WordPress: Crafting Websites with Ease and Security

**WordPress** is a dynamic, open-source content management system (CMS) powered by PHP and designed to seamlessly integrate with MySQL or MariaDB databases. As an open-source CMS, it provides an adaptable platform for website creation and management. WordPress utilizes PHP to dynamically generate web content, ensuring flexibility.

The collaboration with MySQL or MariaDB databases enhances efficiency in handling diverse website elements. Notably, WordPress prioritizes security by actively supporting HTTPS, encrypting data transmission for enhanced privacy.

In brief, WordPress empowers users with a user-friendly interface for content creation, leverages PHP for dynamic page generation, integrates seamlessly with databases, and prioritizes security through HTTPS encryption. It stands as a versatile and secure solution for crafting and managing websites. üåê‚ú®

**Step-by-Step Guide to NGINX Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `wpmysql`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `wordpress`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.
