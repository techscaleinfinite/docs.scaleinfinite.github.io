# ðŸ–¥ WordPress SQLite

### What's WordPress SQLite?

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in hypertext preprocessor language and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database with supported HTTPS. SQLite is an open-source SQL database system that stores data in a text file on a device. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage and retrieve structured information locally.

**Key Points:**

1. **Open-Source SQL:** SQLite is freely accessible, offering SQL database capabilities for local storage.
2. **Text File Storage:** Data is stored in a single text file, eliminating the need for a separate server.
3. **Lightweight:** SQLite is compact, making it suitable for applications with limited resources.
4. **Embedded Database:** It's integrated within the application, not requiring a separate database server.
5. **Self-Contained:** The entire database is contained within a single file, enhancing portability.

### **Working in Brief:**

1. **Database Creation:** Applications integrate SQLite by creating a database file.
2. **Table Structure:** Define tables with columns to structure the data.
3. **Data Storage:** Insert, update, or delete data within the tables.
4. **SQL Queries:** Utilize SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database.
5. **Local Retrieval:** Applications access data directly from the local SQLite file.

SQLite offers a convenient solution for applications that require structured data storage without the complexity of a traditional database system. Its lightweight nature and self-contained design make it an ideal choice for various applications.

### Steps And Procedure&#x20;

&#x20;**Docker image of this application consists of following layers :**

```
'FROM wordpress:latest' Taking Wordpress as the base image

Used PHP scripts to 'install' the SQLite plugin and setting up the database so that the wordpress will recognize the sqlite database. 

```

**Step-by-Step Guide to Wordpress SQlite Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `wpsqlite`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `wordpress1`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an NGINX instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
