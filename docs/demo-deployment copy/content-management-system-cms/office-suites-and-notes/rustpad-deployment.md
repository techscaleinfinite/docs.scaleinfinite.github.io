2. _Web-Based Simplicity: No need for complicated installations or downloads. Just share a link to your Rustpad document, and your friends or colleagues can jump right into editing from their web browsers. It's quick, convenient, and fuss-free._
3. _Live Preview: Watch your document change in real-time as you and your collaborators make edits. It's not just a regular text editor; it's a dynamic canvas for your ideas, coming to life before your eyes._
4. _Uninterrupted Workflow: With Rustpad, there's no need to take turns or send files back and forth. Everyone can edit at the same time, ensuring a smooth and interruption-free workflow._
5. _Version Control: Sometimes, you might want to go back to an earlier version of your document. Rustpad has got you covered with built-in version control, making it easy to revert to previous states._

Rustpad is where the best of innovation meets the simplicity you crave. It's more than just a text editor; it's a collaborative hub for turning ideas into reality in real time. Say farewell to the old-fashioned way of sharing documents and embrace the future of collaborative editing with Rustpad. Give it a try now and discover the seamless magic of real-time collaboration.

**Step-by-Step Guide to RUSTPAD Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `rustpad`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `rustpad`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration****:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `3030`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an Rustpad instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
