5. **Formatting Toolbar:** Markdown Edit often includes a helpful formatting toolbar. This toolbar offers shortcuts and buttons to assist with common markdown formatting tasks, such as making text bold, italic, or creating lists.
6. **Export Options:** Once you've crafted your masterpiece, Markdown Edit allows you to export your document in various formats. This can include standard markdown text, HTML for web publishing, and even PDF for print-ready documents.
7. **Collaboration:** If you're collaborating with others, Markdown Edit usually provides sharing options. You can share your markdown document with colleagues or friends, and they can edit it simultaneously, enabling real-time collaboration.
8. **Accessibility:** Markdown Edit strives to be accessible to everyone. It's designed with features that assist users with disabilities, ensuring a seamless experience for all.

In a nutshell, Markdown Edit takes the complexity out of markdown editing. It's a dynamic, web-based tool that empowers you to create beautifully formatted documents without the hassle. Just type, format, and let Markdown Edit handle the rest! üöÄüìÑüéâ\

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
