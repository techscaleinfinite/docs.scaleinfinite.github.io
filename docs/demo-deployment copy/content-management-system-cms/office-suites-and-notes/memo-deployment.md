**Step-by-Step Guide to mems Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `memos`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: memos
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**

4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```
           - './memos/:/var/opt/memos'
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
