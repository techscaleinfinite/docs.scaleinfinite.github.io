### **How It Works:**

Firefox is a web browser, kind of like a pair of magic glasses that lets you see the internet. It's made by a group called Mozilla, and they're all about making sure the internet is a safe and friendly place for everyone.

When you open Firefox, it's like opening a door to the internet world. You can type in web addresses, and Firefox will take you to those websites. You can also use it to search for things on the internet.

One cool thing about Firefox is that it's open source, which means it's built by a big community of people who share their ideas and make it better all the time. It's like a big group project to create the best web browser.

Firefox also cares a lot about your privacy and security. It has tools that stop sneaky trackers from following you around the internet and collecting your data. There's even a special mode called Private Browsing that makes sure nothing you do online is stored on your computer.

You can make Firefox look and work the way you want by adding themes and extensions. It's like decorating your magic glasses or adding superpowers to them. Some extensions can block ads, save your passwords, or do other helpful things.

Tabs in Firefox are like having multiple windows open at once. You can have lots of websites open in different tabs, and you can even organize them into groups.

Whenever you visit a website, Firefox is working behind the scenes to load all the pictures, text, and videos. It's like a super-fast delivery service for web content.

If you're a developer, Firefox has tools to help you build and test websites. It's like having a toolbox for creating cool stuff on the internet.

And just like your phone, you can use Firefox on different devices like your computer, tablet, or phone. It even syncs your bookmarks and history so you can pick up where you left off, no matter which device you're using.

In a nutshell, Firefox is like your trusty sidekick for exploring the internet. It's designed to keep you safe, give you control, and make your online adventures as enjoyable as possible.

**Step-by-Step Guide to firefox Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `firefox`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `firefox`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an  firefox instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
