# MediaWiki: Crafting Collaborative Knowledge

**MediaWiki**, the force behind Wikipedia, is more than software; it's the architect of collaborative knowledge creation. Users, like a team of friends, contribute and edit articles, creating a digital playground for learning and sharing. With a detailed version control system, users can navigate through the history of changes and revert if needed.

It's not just about text; MediaWiki embraces media with ease, allowing users to incorporate images, audio, and video seamlessly. With user contributions, personal spaces are created, fostering community interaction. The software's markup language simplifies content creation, making it accessible to all. In essence, MediaWiki is the unsung hero behind.

### Exposed Ports

| Port Type | Port Number | Description                        |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Http      | 80          | MediaWiki exposes port 80 for HTTP. |
| Tcp       | -           | -             |

### Volume Mounts

MediaWiki uses volume mounts to manage data storage. You can set these when running the container:

| Volume                                       | Description                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/var/www/html`                              | This is the path where MediaWiki's site files are stored. |

**Step-by-Step Guide to MEDIAWIKI Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `mediawiki`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `mediawiki`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```console
           /var/www/html/sites
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an media wiki instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
