### &#x20;Steps And Procedure

* &#x20;**Docker image of this application consists of following layers :**

```
'FROM debian:buster' Taking debian:buster as the base image.

And updating and installing all the required softwares like 'openssh-server' 'supervisor' 'net-tools'

Installing the Xampp software. And configuring Xampp to Enable web interface, error display in php.

And creating a /www folder and a symbolic link to it in /opt/lampp/htdocs. This is convenient because it doesn't interfere with xampp, phpmyadmin or other tools in /opt/lampp/htdocs.

And exposing 3306, 22 and 80 ports.
```

**Step-by-Step Guide to** XAMPP **Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `xampp`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `xampp1`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```
           -v ~/my_web_pages:/www 
           tomsik68/xampp
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an XAMPP instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
