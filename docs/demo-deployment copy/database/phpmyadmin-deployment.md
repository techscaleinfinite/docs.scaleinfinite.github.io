### What's  php myadmin?

**phpMyAdmin: Your Database Librarian**

Ever wished for a friendly librarian to help you navigate the complexities of your databases? Well, phpMyAdmin is just thatâ€”a trusty browser for your MySQL and MariaDB databases. Let's walk through how it all works:

**1. Web Display** Think of phpMyAdmin as your virtual library. It's right there in your web browser. No need to install anything extra. Just visit the phpMyAdmin URL hosted on your web server, and it's like opening a book in your digital library.

**2. Database Connection** Before you dive into the database world, you'll need the equivalent of a secret handshake: your hostname or IP address, your username, and the associated password. If necessary, you can also specify the port number. It's like proving you're a trusted guest before entering.

**3. User Authentication** Once you've knocked on the virtual door of the database, phpMyAdmin will usually ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. You enter your username and password, and phpMyAdmin will check the database server user account. It's like showing your library card to the librarian.

**4. Database Selection** After passing the virtual browser, it's time to choose the database you want to work with. phpMyAdmin gives you a list of all the databases available on the server. You can select an existing playground or create a completely new one for your data. It's like choosing a bookshelf in your library for your collection.

**5. Navigating the Database** In your chosen database, phpMyAdmin becomes your tour guide. It presents the database structure in a user-friendly interface, often organized in neat tabs and an extensible tree structure. It's like having a map that guides you through the intricacies of the database.

**6. Array Management** Once inside, you're in control. phpMyAdmin allows you to create new tables, modify existing ones, or even shut them down if they're no longer needed. You can also view a table diagram, including columns, data types, and indexes. It's like being the architect of your data world.

In a nutshell, phpMyAdmin is your trusted companion that makes browsing through your database smooth and accessible, even for those who aren't tech-savvy. It's like having a trained librarian in your digital library, helping you organize and understand the treasures in your database.

### **How It Works:**

phpMyAdmin works as a web-based interface for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it operates:

1. **Accessing the Interface**: Users access phpMyAdmin by navigating to its URL through a web browser. The phpMyAdmin interface is hosted on a web server, often the same server where the MySQL or MariaDB database is running.
2. **Login and Authentication**: Upon reaching the phpMyAdmin login page, users are required to provide valid login credentials, including a username and password. These credentials are checked against the user accounts configured in the MySQL or MariaDB database server.
3. **Selecting a Database**: After successful authentication, users can choose a specific database to work with. phpMyAdmin lists all available databases on the server. Users can either select an existing database or create a new one.
4. **Navigation and Database Structure**: Once a database is selected, phpMyAdmin provides a user-friendly interface for navigating its structure. This typically includes a sidebar with an expandable tree view of tables, views, and other database objects. Users can click on these objects to view their details.
5. **Table Management**: Users can manage database tables by creating new tables, modifying existing ones, or deleting tables. phpMyAdmin offers forms for defining table structures, including columns, data types, and indexes.
6. **Data Manipulation**: phpMyAdmin allows users to insert, update, and delete data within database tables. It offers a user-friendly form-based interface for data manipulation.
7. **SQL Query Execution**: For advanced users, phpMyAdmin provides an SQL query interface. Users can execute custom SQL queries directly against the database. This is useful for complex operations, custom reports, and data retrieval.

### Steps And Procedure

*   **This deployment utilizes the official phpmyadmin Docker image. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:**

    1. Begin by navigating to the "Create Apps" page and use the search bar to find the phpmyadmin application.
    2. Click on the "Install" button to initiate the installation process.
    3. Fill in all the required fields with the necessary information.
    4. If you prefer, you can click on the "Advanced" option to access additional settings (this step is optional).
    5. After making your selections, press the "Install" button to proceed.
    6. Once the installation is complete, you'll be directed to the "My Apps" page, where you'll find a list of all the applications you've deployed.
    7. Copy the Hostname of the phpmyadmin application without the NodePort and paste it into your preferred browser's address bar.
    8. VoilÃ ! You're now able to access the phpmyadmin webpage and explore its content.

    By following these straightforward steps, you'll have successfully deployed the phpmyadmin application and gained access to its features through a seamless and user-friendly process.

**Step-by-Step Guide to phpmyadmin Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `phpmyadmin`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `php1`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       * \-v /some/local/directory/config.user.inc.php:/etc/phpmyadmin/config.user.inc.php phpmyadmin
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an phpmyadmin instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
