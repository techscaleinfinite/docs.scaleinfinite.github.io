# foldingathome Deployment
**Foldinghome:**
A distributed computing project focused on simulating protein dynamics, including the complex processes of protein folding and the movements of proteins associated with various diseases. Folding@home engages citizen scientists who volunteer their personal computers to run simulations. The insights derived from this collaborative effort contribute to a deeper understanding of biology and open new avenues for therapeutic development.
