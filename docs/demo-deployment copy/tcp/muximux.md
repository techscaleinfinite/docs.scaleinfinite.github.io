# muximux Deployment

**Muximux:**
A lightweight portal designed for managing Home Theater PC (HTPC) apps. Muximux allows users to view and control their HTPC applications through a single interface, eliminating the need for multiple tabs or bookmarks. It operates with just a PHP-enabled web server, providing a streamlined solution for HTPC app management.
