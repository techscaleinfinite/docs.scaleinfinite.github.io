### What's is Nginx?

Nginx is more than just your run-of-the-mill web server; it's a versatile multitool that enhances your online presence in a multitude of ways:

Web Server: Nginx serves as a nimble and efficient web server, ensuring that web content is delivered swiftly and effectively to users. It's like the reliable engine powering your website, keeping it up and running smoothly.

Reverse Proxy: Acting as a diligent guardian, Nginx functions as a reverse proxy, skillfully managing external requests to safeguard your applications. It's akin to a vigilant gatekeeper, allowing only authorized traffic to pass through.

Load Balancer: Nginx takes on the role of a traffic conductor, expertly distributing incoming requests among multiple servers. This load-balancing act ensures optimal performance and reliability, as if orchestrating a harmonious symphony of server resources.

Mail Proxy: In the realm of email infrastructure, Nginx shines as a proficient mail proxy, efficiently routing emails to their intended destinations. It's like the postal service's secret weapon, ensuring your emails reach their recipients without a hitch.

HTTP Cache: Nginx boasts a remarkable capability as an HTTP cache, where it stores and serves frequently accessed resources. This cache acts as a well-organized library, enabling faster delivery of web content by reducing the need to fetch data repeatedly.

### **How It Works**

Nginx's event-driven architecture handles multiple connections simultaneously, making it perfect for high-traffic scenarios. It's resource-efficient and enhances application performance, all while being open-source and free.

**Step-by-Step Guide to NGINX Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: `nginx`
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: `nginx1`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an NGINX instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
