# nzbhydra2 Deployment
**NZBHydra2:**
A meta-search application for NZB indexers, NZBHydra2 is the "spiritual successor" to NZBmegasearcH and an evolution of the original NZBHydra. It facilitates easy access to various raw and newznab-based indexers. NZBHydra 2 is designed to replace NZBHydra 1, supporting migration from V1 with a note of potential compatibility issues. Users are advised to back up their old configuration before transitioning to the new version.
