# ðŸ”’ Caddy Deployment

### What's is caddy?

**Caddy: Simplifying Web Servers**

*Caddy*, the modern web server, excels in simplicity, efficiency, and security. Offering a user-friendly experience, it streamlines configuration with its human-readable Caddyfile. With automatic HTTPS setup, Caddy effortlessly summons SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, ensuring secure content delivery. As a master of reverse proxy, it expertly directs requests for hosting multiple services, while graceful load balancing guarantees high availability. Caddy's prowess extends to URL tweaking, SEO-friendly redirects, and efficient handling of multiple connections, making it a speed demon in web server technology. Its feature ensemble, including plugins and middleware, contributes to a harmonious, efficient, and secure web server experience.

**Step-by-Step Guide to caddy Deployment**

1. **Docker Image Selection:**
   * Docker Image Name: caddy
2. **Application Details:**
   * Application Name: caddy
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. **Protocol Configuration:**
   * Protocol: http
   * Port: 80
4. **Installation Options:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. **Advanced Installation (Optional):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )
       *

           ```console
           /usr/share/caddy/index.html
           ```
6. **Access Configuration:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. **Installation:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an HOMER instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
