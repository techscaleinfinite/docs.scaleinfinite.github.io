### **Troubleshooting FileZilla Connection Issues**

If you're experiencing connection issues with FileZilla, particularly when using Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. **Check Network Connection**:
   * Ensure that your computer is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network or mobile hotspot.
   * Check if you have a stable internet connection by visiting a website in your web browser.
2. **Firewall and Antivirus**:
   * Firewalls and antivirus software can sometimes block FileZilla's connection. Check your firewall and antivirus settings to ensure they are not blocking FileZilla's access to the internet.
   * Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus and try connecting again to see if the issue persists.
3. **Check Server Details**:
   * Double-check that you've entered the correct server hostname, port number, and protocol (FTP or SFTP) in FileZilla's Site Manager.
4. **Passive Mode**:
   * Try switching between active and passive mode in FileZilla's settings. Go to _"Edit" > "Settings" > "Connection" > "FTP" > "Transfer Mode"_ and switch between _"Active"_ and "Passive."
5. **Network Restrictions**:
   * Some networks, especially public Wi-Fi networks, might have restrictions that prevent certain ports or protocols from working. Try connecting from a different network to see if the issue persists.
6. **Mobile Hotspot Troubleshooting**:
   * If you're using a mobile hotspot to connect, make sure that the hotspot is enabled and has a stable connection to the internet.
   * Verify that you have sufficient mobile data or the hotspot is not restricted by your mobile carrier.
7. **Restart Router/Hotspot**:
   * Sometimes, network issues can be resolved by restarting your router or mobile hotspot. Turn off the device, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back on.
8. **Check FileZilla Logs**:
   * FileZilla logs can provide more information about connection issues. Go to _"View" > "Message Log"_ to see if there are any error messages.
9. **Update FileZilla**:
   * Make sure you are using the latest version of FileZilla. Outdated software can sometimes cause compatibility issues.
10. **Try a Different FTP Client**:
    * If you're still experiencing issues, consider trying a different FTP client to see if the problem is specific to FileZilla.
